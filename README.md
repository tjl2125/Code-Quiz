# Code-Quiz-with-Web-APIs

## Description 
From the perspective of a boot camp student, I have created a quiz on Javascript information.The quiz is able to storage information locally and compares scores between other 
inputted players. Scores are listed from highest to lowest. Players press a button in order
to start the quiz and are presented with 5 questions that have 4 choices. There is also a
timer counting down and if a person chooses the wrong answer, the timer deducts 5 extra
seconds.
